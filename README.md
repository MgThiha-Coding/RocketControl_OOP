# RocketControlSuite

## Overview
**RocketControlSuite** is a simulation and control system for rocket launches, developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Dart. This project models the key components of a rocket's flight, including thrusters, fuel systems, and empannage sections.

The system is designed to be easily extendable, with clear separation of concerns using OOP concepts like **inheritance**, **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism**.

## Features
- **Thrust Management**: Simulates the main thrusters and Vernier thrusters for precise control.
- **Fuel Systems**: Models liquid hydrogen and oxygen fuel tanks with dynamic control based on fuel levels.
- **Empannage Section**: Ejects the empannage at the correct altitude during the flight.
- **OOP Design**: Uses inheritance, polymorphism, and composition to create a scalable and modular architecture.
